r"""The render inputs, and the fingerprints that identify one tree state.

A copier render is a pure function of the answers and the template tree, so the
tree state can be named by a content digest instead of a git revision: copier
renders a *dirty* working tree as it finds it (it warns `DirtyLocalWarning`),
which is exactly what the tests and the MCP tools want to key on.

This module owns the render's file-level vocabulary, so the consumers cannot
drift apart (TODO.md §28.3 3c / §28.5 R3): the test suite's on-disk render
cache (`tests/render_cache.py`, which namespaces its entries and records the
consumed inputs) and the render twin (`tools/render_delta.py`, which narrows
the re-render candidates) both read the watched-path list, the include graph
and the output-name rule from here, and the repo MCP server's
`template_fingerprint()` tool reports the digest to an agent deciding whether
the render it holds is stale.

What is covered: every file under `template/` and `_shared/`, plus `copier.yml`
and `_tasks.jinja`, as `sha256(relative path + \\0 + sha256(content))` over the
sorted paths. Symlinks are followed, because copier follows them
(`preserve_symlinks` is off): the template's payload links
(`template/.vscode -> ../.vscode`, `template/.../tests/conftest.py -> the repo's
tests/conftest.py`, ...) put the *linked* bytes into the render, so editing
either side of a link must change the digest. `Path.rglob` does not descend a
symlinked directory and a trailing `**` matches directories rather than the
files inside them, so directory links are queued explicitly; the queue is keyed
on resolved paths, so a link pointing back into a tree already walked cannot
loop.

The answers half of a render's inputs has its own fingerprint
(`context_fingerprint`): `copier.yml`, `questions/*.yml` and the witness leaf
list -- what a leaf's render context depends on when the template body does
not.
