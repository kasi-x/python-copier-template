"""The inverse template: name the features you want, get the answers that produce them.

Templates make users answer 60+ questions. This repo already *verifies* the
answer->artifact correspondence mechanically -- the 225 witness leaves in
tests/matrix/witnesses.jsonl (each a full answer set), the per-leaf render
contexts (copier's own questionnaire pass, the tools/predicates.py oracle) and
tests/matrix/invariants.yml claiming which artifacts each configuration ships.
The inverse mapping is therefore available without guessing: given the
features you WANT, find the answers that produce them. This module is that
mapping, v1: exact match over the leaf space, with honest diagnostics.

**Constraints** (the language, deliberately tiny):

    name=value   the question or internal whose context value equals the
                 string (booleans also accept `name=true` / `name=false`)
    name         the value must be truthy
    -name        the value must be falsy
    name!=value  the value must not equal the string

Mixed forms (`-name=value`, `-name!=value`) are refused: the negation of an
equality is spelled `name!=value`.

A name may be an asked question (`docker`, `docs_type`, `project_type`, ...)
or a derived internal (`mcp_effective`, `sphinx`, `use_gpu_effective`,
`license_effective`, ...) -- whatever the render context exposes, minus
copier's private plumbing (`_`-prefixed) and the render clock (`now`). An
unknown name is rejected with the closest real names suggested (difflib).

**Matching**: every leaf whose context satisfies all constraints is reported
with its id, its full answers as YAML ready for `copier copy --data-file`,
and the artifacts its class ships (tests/matrix/invariants.yml via
tools/invariants.py). When nothing matches, the report says so loudly: which
constraint eliminated the most leaves, and the nearest leaf by satisfied
constraints, with what it misses. Never a silent empty result.

**The render proof** (`--render`): the top matching leaf is rendered through
tools/batch.py (one request -- the same run a witness gets, post-generation
tasks and `expect` checks included), and every constraint is then proved
against the rendered tree twice over: the render's own `.copier-answers.yml`
drives a fresh copier pass whose context must satisfy each constraint (the
general proof), and where an internal ships a name-gated artifact
(``ARTIFACT_PROOFS``) or the license lands in pyproject.toml, the file itself
must agree. The render is the proof the answers are real.

The render contexts are cached under `.cache/answers-for/`, keyed by
copier.yml + questions/*.yml + witnesses.jsonl -- the same inputs
tools/render_delta.py keys its context hashes by -- so a template body edit
never re-runs the pass; only a questionnaire or leaf-list change does.

Usage:

    python tools/answers_for.py --require docs_type=zensical --require use_gpu_effective=true
    python tools/answers_for.py --require docker=true --render --keep
    python tools/answers_for.py --require license=MIT --json

Exit codes: 0 a leaf matched (and, with --render, the proof held);
1 no leaf matched, or the render proof failed; 2 a constraint is malformed
or names something the questionnaire never produces.
