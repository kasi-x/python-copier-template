"""Report drift between vendored ethics sections and good-future-codex.

_shared/ethics/ is a vendored snapshot of ConstitutiveTemplates/good-future-codex
(the canonical section texts of the Good-future charter). This script is the
consumer-side half of the sync contract in docs/explanations/ethics-external.md:
it diffs the vendored tree against the codex at the SHA recorded in
.ethics-vendored, and again at codex's current main, so a run answers both
"is the vendored copy clean" and "is upstream ahead of it".

Exits 0 when the vendored tree matches the marker AND the marker is codex's
main; exits 1 on either drift (dirty vendor or upstream ahead). Runs from a
pristine checkout: it clones the codex into a temp dir rather than touching
any named remote.
