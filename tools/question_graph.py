"""The questionnaire's dependency graph: what references what, in which order, and where new definitions fit.

The questionnaire's questions and its internal `when: false` variables form a
dependency graph -- internals reference questions and other internals, and a
question's `when:`/`default:` reference internals -- and copier evaluates it
in DEFINITION ORDER (the include chain over questions/, top-level key order
within a fragment). A definition must therefore precede every reference: a
backward reference silently reads Undefined (falsy) and picks the wrong
branch. That bit twice (the docs_type -> micropython_pkg back-reference and
the mcp_effective -> web_api ordering, TODO.md §13), and the two structure
tests (`test_question_references_are_forward_only`,
`test_internal_variable_references_are_forward_only` in
tests/test_copier_structure.py) now enforce it -- after the fact. As gates,
layers and platforms are added, this hand-managed ordering is the most
fragile part of the questionnaire; this tool makes it visible and plannable
BEFORE the next edit breaks it. It reuses the existing parsers
(tools/questionnaire.load_questions for the ask order and source fragments,
tools/when_model.jinja_identifiers for the identifier reads) -- no second
Jinja parser lives here.

Three capabilities:

1. **The graph**: one node per asked question and per internal, with its
   fragment and position (fragment line + index in definition order); one
   edge per reference read out of `when` + `default`, classified question /
   internal / external. Identifiers that name no definition (Jinja filters
   like `replace`, method names like `strftime`) are external leaves:
   reported for the record, never failures.
2. **Validation**: the forward-reference rule, recomputed. For an asked
   question, ANY reference to a later definition is a violation (the
   question resolves when it is asked; nothing later exists yet). For an
   internal, only internal-to-internal edges are order-bound -- internals
   resolve at render time, after every answer exists, so reading a later
   *asked* question is fine (exactly the split the two structure tests
   draw). A violation is reported with both names and both positions;
   exit status 1.
3. **The placement guide** (``--where NAME``): where a new internal or
   question named NAME -- whose references are given with ``--refs`` -- may
   live, and what currently occupies that spot. This answers "where do I
   add the new gate's internals": after the last definition it reads, before
   anything that will read it, and (repo convention, see
   docs/explanations/template-dev.md) internals that questions reference
   live in their genre fragment before the asking gate, render-only
   internals at the end of questions/_internal.yml.

Usage:

    python tools/question_graph.py                # the human report (on stderr)
    python tools/question_graph.py --json         # the machine report (stdout; prose stays on stderr)
    python tools/question_graph.py --where mygate_effective --refs include_mygate,project_type
    python tools/question_graph.py --where mcp_effective   # an existing name: its own refs, its window
