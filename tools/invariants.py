"""What a render of the questionnaire must satisfy, read from one file.

``tests/matrix/invariants.yml`` is the single source for "what a leaf must
satisfy": the artifacts it ships and must not ship, the content predicates
that hold on them, its witness tier and the reason a question type is left out
(TODO.md §26.4 item 4, §23.4 item 2). This module is the only reader of that
file, so the schema is enforced in one place and a typo cannot silently shrink
a class's invariants:

- every row key, ``select`` key and ``select`` value is checked against the
  questionnaire (``project_type`` choices, ``oj_kind`` choices, the
  ``include_*`` questions, the ``use_recommended_*`` gates) and against the
  file's own predicate registry and tier vocabulary. An unknown key or value
  raises ``InvariantError`` naming the row;
- every ``project_type`` the questionnaire offers must be selected by a row,
  and a row may not select an excluded one;
- every ``excluded`` entry is held against the live questionnaire: an excluded
  ``project_type`` must not be offered again, an excluded ``question`` must
  still be declared -- either way a stale exclusion fails at load, not in the
  witness output;
- a leaf whose answers carry a dimension value no row selects (a new judge, a
  new layer, a gate nobody declared) is reported by ``unclaimed`` and refused
  by ``expect_for`` instead of quietly resolving to the common layout.

A leaf's expectation is the ordered union of the rows its answers select:
"base first, override last" is the file's order, in which ``ships``/``absent``
concatenate and a later row's tier takes precedence for the classes it
selects.

Consumers:

- ``tools/z3_witnesses.py`` builds each §C6 request's ``expect`` with
  ``expect_for`` and takes everything the leaf space keeps out (the excluded
  project types and the excluded questions) from ``excluded``/``excluded_questions``;
- ``tests/test_recommended_path.py`` derives its fast-path ``MARKERS`` (branch
  tells) with ``markers_for`` and its per-case content checks with
  ``content_for``;
- ``tests/test_render_invariants.py`` looks up which content predicates a leaf
  must satisfy with ``predicates_for``;
- ``tests/test_invariants.py`` holds the loader's contract and the meta checks
  (every witness leaf resolves to a row, and the union reproduces the
  committed ``expect``).
