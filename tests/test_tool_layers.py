"""The tools/ dependency layers are declared, and no import points up.

tools/ grew to nineteen modules with an IMPLICIT layering: every cross-module
import is spelled `from tools import x`, but nothing recorded which modules sit
where, so "may adopt.py use invariants?" was answerable only by reading all of
them. The layering is now a declared contract, in the repo's registry idiom
(tests/test_answer_fixtures.py's DEFAULT_REPEATS_ALLOWED, tests/matrix/
invariants.yml's `excluded`): declared, not discovered, and enforced here
structurally -- an `ast` scan of the import statements, no runtime import, so
the check costs milliseconds and cannot go red because a tool grew an expensive
import.

The layers, bottom up (the table also lives in docs/explanations/template-dev.md,
next to the other structural rules):

    standalone   maintenance/CI scripts that run on their own: they import
                 nothing from tools/ (check_upstream, check_upstream_fork,
                 check_questionnaire_diff, generate_license_template)
    foundations  the questionnaire model and shared primitives: the
                 questionnaire as data (questionnaire), its when-expressions
                 (when_model), the shared answer fixture (answers), the
                 render-input fingerprint (render_inputs)
    machinery    pure transformations over template/adoption artifacts: the
                 text and pyproject merges (file_merge, pyproject_merge), the
                 leaf invariants (invariants) and the Z3 leaf enumerator
                 (z3_witnesses)
    drivers      the tools that act on real trees with copier/subprocess:
                 detect, batch, adopt, the condition classifier built on
                 the machinery (predicates), the inverse selector that
                 turns wanted features into witness answers (answers_for),
                 and the questionnaire dependency graph built on the
                 foundations (question_graph)
    frontends    the entry points an agent or a human calls: cli, gen_docs,
                 mcp_server

The rule: a module may import modules of its own layer or any layer BELOW it.
An import that points up fails here, unless the pair is declared in
ALLOWED_UPWARD_IMPORTS with a one-line reason -- a genuine tangle that is not
worth refactoring away is stated, not hidden. Both halves are stale-proofed
the way DEFAULT_REPEATS_ALLOWED is: an undeclared upward import fails, and so
does a declared exception whose edge has vanished or stopped pointing up.

A new module under tools/ fails
`test_every_tool_module_is_declared_in_exactly_one_layer` until it is placed:
pick the layer it belongs in, and the import-direction test tells you whether
the guess was right.
