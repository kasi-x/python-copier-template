"""Behavioral guard for the generation commands documented in the repo's docs.

The docs show `uvx copier copy --trust <url> ...` with no `--vcs-ref`, which
makes copier expand the repository's **newest git tag**. Since the 6.0.0 fork
detach that tag is the fork's own release, so the documented command generates
from the fork questionnaire (`questions/*.yml`). Before the detach the newest
tag was an inherited pre-fork one (`5.4.0`, DiamondLightSource template
content): a default copy silently generated the old template (the real
"docs_type rejects zensical" and "asks component_owner" bug reports; see
BUG.md and COPIER_UPSTREAM.md item 9) and demanded `author_name` outright,
which is why the docs used to pin `--vcs-ref=main`.

The render below deliberately passes no `vcs_ref`, so the test fails if the
newest tag ever stops carrying the fork questionnaire.
