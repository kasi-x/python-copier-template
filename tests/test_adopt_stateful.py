"""Model-based test of an adoption: the driver, checked against a reference model.

TODO.md §25.3 judges Hypothesis the cheapest way to an executable specification
of adoption, and §26.4 V4 puts it to work. The machine builds a random project
tree, runs a random sequence of real adoptions against it (tools/adopt.py,
copier through tools/batch.py, the real merges), and after *every* step asserts
the tree against a model that knows the contract rather than the code:

- adoption adds and never rewrites: a file the model owns comes back byte for
  byte, unless it is a merge kind, and a merge may only append;
- a merge kind whose entries are missing ends up carrying them, and one that
  already carries them keeps them;
- a failed, cancelled or dry run leaves the tree exactly as the model says;
- a run killed mid-flight leaves a journal, an unseen but bounded selection of
  new files, and no damage to the model's files -- and `--recover` puts the
  tree back byte for byte, directories included; the undo is a crash region
  like the run it undoes: a rollback killed while it undoes an uncovered
  collision, and a recovery killed before it drops the journal, are sampled
  too, and the next `--recover` still lands byte for byte;
- the journal exists while a run is unfinished and is gone once it commits or
  rolls back, and a run started over a stale journal is refused untouched.

The model is written from the outside. `TEMPLATE_FILES`/`PROTECTED_FILES` below
are what the fixture ships; every expectation is derived from those plus the
rules above, and `declared_values`/`gitignore_entries` read the adopter's files
with the standard library rather than through the driver's own helpers. When
the model and the driver disagree, the shrunk sequence is a finding about the
driver -- not a reason to adjust the model.

The template rendered here is a miniature one, built by the test, not
`template/`: the subject is the protocol in tools/adopt.py, and a miniature
template turns a 1.6s adoption into ~50ms, which is what makes 100 sequences
affordable in the edit loop (measured on 16 cores: ~13-19s of one worker's time
for the 100, i.e. a second or so of the tier's wall, which is work-bound). No
venv, no network, and the trees stay small.
